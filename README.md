# Budget App

This is a basic Budget App made with React that implements Google OAuth and React Slider.

## Installation

In your terminal, clone the repo down:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:rhuwellsamano/budget-app.git
```

Change into the budget-app directory then use the package manager npm to install the Budget App.
```bash
yarn install
```

## Usage

Run the application by entering:
```bash
yarn budget
```

Alternatively, yarn start works as well:
```bash
yarn start
```

*Note: This is application only works on http://localhost:3000 (only on Port 3000); 
CORS will block you otherwise.*

Just login with yout Google Account and you're in!

- Slide the Slider to alter the Election Percentage (between 1% and 30%)
- Adjust your Salary Income (it will adjust to USD)
- Review your projected numbers in the second panel

## Possible Updates?
I'm considering improving the CSS styling and refactoring out the code into separate components.
